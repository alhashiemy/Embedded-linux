"The darkest nights produce the brightest stars."
"Rainbows can't shine without a little rain."
"Tough times never last, but tough people do."
"After the rain comes the rainbow."
"Every storm runs out of rain."
"You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think."
"The sun will rise and we will try again."
"Stars can't shine without darkness."
"Every day may not be good, but there's something good in every day."
"This too shall pass."
